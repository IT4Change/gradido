## Birth hash

- every human should have the possibility to get a active or passive basic income in Gradido
- but only once per human
- identify human by birth-hash containing first name, birth name, birth date, birth city, birth country, first and birth name from mother and father
- humans with missing names for vather and/or mother and later discover get an new birth hash, invalidate the old one
- check by new birth hash, if similar hash without parents exist (without both, without father, without mother)
